Problem 1. What is SQL? What is DML? What is DDL? Recite the most important SQL commands.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held in a 
relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).

DDL (data definition language or data description language) is a syntax similar to a computer programming language for 
defining data structures, especially database schemas. DDL Statements:

CREATE - make a new database, table, index, or stored procedure.

DROP - destroy an existing database, table, index, or view.

ALTER - modify an existing database object.

DML (A data manipulation language) is a family of syntax elements similar to a computer programming language used 
for selecting, inserting, deleting and updating data in a database. Main Statements:

SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...
INSERT INTO ... VALUES ...
UPDATE ... SET ... WHERE ...
DELETE FROM ... WHERE ...
