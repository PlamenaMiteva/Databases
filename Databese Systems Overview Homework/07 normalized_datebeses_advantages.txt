Problem 7. Advantages of Normalized Databases



The benefits of normalization include:

- Searching, sorting, and creating indexes is faster, since tables are narrower, and more rows fit on a data page.

- More flexibility in tuning queries due to the more clustered indexes (one per table).

- Index searching is often faster, since indexes tend to be narrower and shorter.

- More tables allow better use of segments to control physical placement of data.

- Faster data modification commands as you have fewer indexes per table. 

- More compact datebase (fewer null values and less redundant data).

- Triggers execute more quickly when redundant data are  not maintained.

- Data modification anomalies are reduced.

- Normalization is conceptually cleaner and easier to maintain and change as your needs change.

- While fully normalized databases require more joins, joins are generally very fast if indexes are available on the join columns.

Adaptive Server is optimized to keep higher levels of the index in cache, so each join performs only one or two physical I/Os for each matching row.

The cost of finding rows already in the data cache is extremely low.
