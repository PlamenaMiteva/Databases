Problem 4. Difference between a Primary and Foreign Key

A primary key is a field or combination of fields that uniquely identify a record in a table, so that an individual record can be located without confusion.
Primary keys enforce entity integrity by uniquely identifying entity instances.

A foreign key (sometimes called a referencing key) is a key used to link two tables together. 
Typically the primary key field from one table is inserted into the other table where it becomes a foreign key 
(it remains a primary key in the original table).Foreign keys enforce referential integrity by completing an association between two entities.

Diffrences between primary and foreign keys:

- primary keys can not accept "null values"

- primary keys uniquely identify a record in the table while foreign key is a field in the table that is primary key in another table.

- We can have only one Primary key and more than one foreign key in a table.

- By default, Primary key is clustered index and data in the database table is physically organized in the sequence of clustered index.
Foreign key do not automatically create an index, clustered or non-clustered. You can manually create an index on foreign key.
