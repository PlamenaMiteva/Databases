Problem 12. What is a NoSQL Database?

A non-relational database is a database that does not incorporate the table/key model that relational database management systems (RDBMS) promote. 
These kinds of databases require data manipulation techniques and processes designed to provide solutions to big data problems that big companies face. 
The most popular emerging non-relational database is called NoSQL (Not Only SQL).

Non-relational databases forgo the table form of rows and columns relational databases use in favor of specialized frameworks to store data, 
which can be accessed by special query APIs.

Persistence is an important element in these databases. To enable fast throughput of vast amounts of data the best option for performance is "in memory," 
rather than reading and writing from disks. 

NoSQL databases examplaes:

- Column data model: Accumulo, Cassandra, Druid, HBase, Vertica
- Document data model: Lotus Notes, Clusterpoint, Apache CouchDB, Couchbase, HyperDex, MarkLogic, MongoDB, OrientDB, Qizx
- Key-value data model: CouchDB, Dynamo, FoundationDB, HyperDex, MemcacheDB, Redis, Riak, FairCom c-treeACE, Aerospike, OrientDB, MUMPS
- Graph data model: Allegro, Neo4J, InfiniteGraph, OrientDB, Virtuoso, Stardog
- Multi-model: OrientDB, FoundationDB, ArangoDB, Alchemy Database, CortexDB
